# Semantic HTML Demo

A demo project of CSS techniques for styling an unchanging "semantic" HTML
document in three dramatically-different page styles. It accompanies this
Art+Logic blog post: _(Link to follow)_.

The deployed page is viewable
[here](https://artandlogic.github.io/semantic-html-demo/).

The page is built using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), not because it (being a simple static page) needs
any of the features from those libraries, but rather just to demonstrate that
the techniques for styling semantic HTML work just fine even in larger
applications making use of libraries and frameworks.
